# An app for locking your screen - Intended for use as a subroutine!

This app is intended to be used as a subroutine for **Google Assistant**. So you can just say "Lock my Phone" and the assistant will lock your phone for you!

## Installation:-

- Install the app from the `.apk` file included in the `app` folder.
- Grant it admin privileges through your *device admin* settings.

    **Note**: You can check what kind of permissions it asks for to be sure, it will only ask for the `Lock Phone` functionality.
- Run the app. If done correctly, it'll instantly lock your screen. This lock is exactly the same as pressing the physical lock key.

*To add it as a subroutine for Google Assistant*:-

- Go to **Google Assistant settings**, and then the *Assistant* tab.
- Click on **Routines**
- Click **Add a routine**
- Click on **Add commands** and enter the phrase you'd like to say to invoke this routine
- Click on **Add action** and type in "Open PhLocker", PhLocker being the app name.

That's it! Go ahead and try it out!
